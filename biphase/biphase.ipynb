There exist (at least) three GROMACS commands that can be used to generate a liquid box: `gmx insert-molecules`, `gmx solvate` and `gmx genconf`.

When `gmx insert-molecules` is called, GROMACS tries to fit the requested number of molecules in a box, but it might not be able to do it in its first try. We can specify the number of insertion tries per molecule using the `-try` flag; the higher, the closer the number of inserted molecules will be to the specified one.

The end result will be a system that is homogeneous along x and y, and roughly half-filled by water and half-filled by hexane along z. Due to the use of periodic boundary conditions, two water-hexane interfaces will be created. As a matter of personal taste, I find having one interface located close to the periodic edge very *unsettling*. Hence, we are also going to center the system on the hexane phase.
